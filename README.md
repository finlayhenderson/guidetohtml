## How do I use HTML?
We can split HTML into two basic parts, **head** tag and the **body** tag.
These tags make up your basic HTML page.

We can make a really basic webiste by using this code:

    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>

Once you copy and paste or type it into a code editor or notepad, save it as ```index.html```.
Then go to your file explorer and double click/run the file.

Congratulations, you just made an HTML website!
