# A Guide to HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for `Hyper Text Markup Language`, and is what the web is built up apon.

> For more info goto: https://wikipedia.com/wiki/HTML

## How do I use HTML?
We can split HTML into two basic parts, **head** tag and the **body** tag.
These tags make up your basic HTML page.

We can make a really basic webiste by using this code:

    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>

Once you copy and paste or type it into a code editor or notepad, save it as ```index.html```.
Then go to your file explorer and double click/run the file.

Congratulations, you just made an HTML website!

## The More Technical Stuff
So you want to further your website?
Lets make it look a bit better!

First of all, goto the `<head>` section and add;

    <title>Advanced Website</title>

Save and reload the file.

Next, let's add some more text to the website!
Goto the `<body>` section and add;

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis urna felis, euismod a accumsan in.</p>

Save and reload the file.

## Closing Words
I am only making this to help people understand the basics of HTML. There will so many things I don't cover or just miss out.

The people above will do a much better job than explaining HTML than what I can do here!
